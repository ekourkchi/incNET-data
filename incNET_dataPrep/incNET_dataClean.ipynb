    "This notebook discuss how we have manually labelled spiral galaxies using an [online GUI](http://edd.ifa.hawaii.edu/inclination/) in a collaborative project. Users of the interface are asked to situate a target galaxy within a lattice of galaxies with established inclinations. In this graphical interface, we use the colorful images provided [SDSS](https://www.sdss.org/) as well as the `g`, `r` and `i` band images generated for our photometry program. These latter are presented in black-and-white after re-scaling by the `asinh` function to differentiate more clearly the internal structures of galaxies. The inclination of standard galaxies were initially measured based on their `I`-band axial ratios."
